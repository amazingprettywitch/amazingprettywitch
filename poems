    <p>Praise the ear. <br>
    Praise the hair curling <br>
    around the ear.<br>
    <br>
    Praise the music <br>
    we never turn on,<br>
    only make.<br>
    <br>
    Praise the caps<br>
    of your shoulders, my lips<br>
    pressed against them<br>
    <br>
    Praise the poem<br>
    I was trying to finish <br>
    when you showed up<br>
    <br>
    at my door<br>

      <p>he has a way of honouring my body<br>
      honestly and gently<br>
      i'm embraced by a genuine and intimate appreciation<br>
      for my essence and compassion<br>
      kissing him is like meditation<br>
      i can feel my presence<br>
      <br>
      i like to kiss him slow<br>
      so we can feel the way our lips move together<br>
      i like to pause and pull away<br>
      to feel the magnet that quickly pulls my lips back to his<br>
      i like to watch his expressions as i explore his body<br>
      to make me want him more<br>
      i feel the magic in our slightest touch<br>
      the force of intention between our skin<br>
      stronger than simple contact<br>
      i crave the anticipation<br>
      and bathe in our satisfaction<br>
      <br>
      when our bodies share space<br>
      we can make anything happen<br>
      when we make a wish we know it will come true<br>
